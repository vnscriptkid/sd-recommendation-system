## Approaches
1. Content filtering (Exploitation)
- If i bought iphone, then i might need an iphone case. Because iphone is similar to iphone case

3. Collaborative filtering (Exploration)
- If my friend watch yoga video, then i might be interested in yoga too. Because we're alike

## Similarity
- Cosine Similarity
  - n-dimensional space
  - vector: float[]
  - cos(0) = 1 => similar, cos(90) = 0 => dis-similar
